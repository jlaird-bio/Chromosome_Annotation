# Chromosome_Annotation

> This rough script attempts the following:
> NOTE: This program purposefully does not use formatters as an experiment in programming efficiency

1. Using a chromosome and its coordinates this program finds its corresponding annotation

2. Reports the query and annotation to the file chr_annotate_lookup.txt

3. Change the paths to meet the needs of your directory

4. Working on making this program faster
